Here I will document how to run injections for CHIME/Pulsar filterbank files
*Injections*
- run multiple_inject.sh (use -l if running locally)
- run mutlple_detect.sh 
- at the same time run run_check_single_pulse.sh
- python combine_inject_stats.py *.fil

You should get an overall curve that tells you how CHIPSPIPE has done
